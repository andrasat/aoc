# Advent of Code

This is my attempt for Advent of Code. Currently doing 2022, hopefully i can continue this until the first AOC. I'm using Go and Rust for this.

To run go files, use this command

```bash
  $ go run go-aoc/2022/main.go
```

to run rust files, move into rust directory first, then use this command

```bash
  $ cargo run
```
